This thesis aims to explore how blockchain technology can be integrated and implemented within hospitals to manage patient file registration and privacy. More specifically, this thesis will look at the advantages and disadantages of adopting blockchain for this particular case, while also discussing the necessary changes and possible pitfalls that such a change of system could imply.

*Note*: Open to all Masters.
