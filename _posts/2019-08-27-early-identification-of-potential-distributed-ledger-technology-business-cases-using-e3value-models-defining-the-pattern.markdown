Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) like Blockchain are being experimented with in nearly every economic sector. Most of the time, projects donâ€™t survive after their first year and it has proven to be extremely difficult to reap benefits from implementing DLT. What is currently missing is an analytical tool that allows early decision-making on DLT implementation.

In a recent paper, we explored the ability of the e3value enterprise modeling technique to provide early indications of potential DLT business cases. In the paper we apply e3value modeling to two DLT cases: peer-to-peer energy trading and digital image rights trading. We observed that, despite the difference in sector, both models were quite similar. By abstracting from the specific domains modelled, we created an abstract e3value model that, according to our analysis, provides indications of the potential business case for DLT.

The goal of the master dissertation is to apply our abstract model to additional DLT cases, in order to confirm (or not) the pattern of indications that we discovered. Given that a pattern is established, decision-makers will have a tool to analyse the viability of DLT projects in an early stage, which should ultimately lead to less resources wasted on projects that lack the potential to lead to successful DLT implementation.
