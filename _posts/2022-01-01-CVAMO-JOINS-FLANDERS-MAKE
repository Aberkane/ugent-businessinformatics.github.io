Cost and Value Analytics, Models & Optimization (CVAMO) is a new research lab that groups 10 professors and about 28 pre- or postdoctoral researchers form different departments linked to the degree in Business Engineering at the faculty of Economics and Business Administration (Ghent University). The goal of CVAMO is to successfully leverage technological innovation to competitive business growth. This can only be realized when there is a mutual understanding about technological aspects on the one hand and cost and value drivers on the other hand. 
 
CVAMO is a core lab in the Strategic Research Center Flanders Make (www.flandersmake.be), that groups research labs from all Flemmish universities. Based on high-tech research, Flanders Make offers active support to companies in the manufacturing industry to develop and optimize products and production processes.
