Although the initial hype of NoSQL databases seems to be over, and the concept has evolved into ‘not only SQL’ databases, there is the question whether this database technology should substitute or complement traditional business students university education in relational databases (i.e., entity-relationship modeling, relational database design, SQL).

This thesis involves literature study, web search and survey research into the practice and teaching of NoSQL databases. The envisioned result is a well-founded comparison of NoSQL and relational databases with implications for university teaching.
