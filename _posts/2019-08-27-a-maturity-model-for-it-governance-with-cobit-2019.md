COBIT 2019 is the revised framework for enterprise governance of information &amp; technology. A new step in the development of COBIT is a model for assessing the IT governance maturity and capabilities of an organization. Such model should allow evaluating the performance of the IT governance system.

The thesis will start with a literature review of design approaches for maturity/capability models. Next, a generic maturity model for COBIT needs to be designed and tested on a chosen COBIT component (e.g., information, organisational structures, infrastructure, ..).

The student will closely cooperate with the COBIT development team.
