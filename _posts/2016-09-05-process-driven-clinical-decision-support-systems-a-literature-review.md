### **Problem description** 

Clinical decision support (CDS) provides clinicians, staff, patients or other individuals with knowledge and person-specific information, intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care. CDS encompasses a variety of tools to enhance decision-making in the clinical workflow. These tools include computerized alerts and reminders to care providers and patients; clinical guidelines; condition-specific order sets; focused patient data reports and summaries; documentation templates; diagnostic support, and contextually relevant reference information, among other tools.

However, mainstream CDS systems have just a limited notion of the process that is being executed.

### **Research objectives/approach**

In this thesis you will create an overview and classification of CDS systems available in literature based on their focus on the underlying process. In the first phase you will gather information about the types of CDS systems that are available. In the next phase you will have to evaluate the CDS systems based on their support and integration of the underlying processes.
