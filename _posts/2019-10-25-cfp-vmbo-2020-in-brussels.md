## Welcome

It is our pleasure to invite you to submit a paper to the 14th International Workshop on Value Modelling and Business Ontologies (VMBO 2020) on January 16th to 17th, 2020. This workshop will be held in the Université Saint-Louis in Brussels, Belgium.

The importance of modeling the essence of enterprises on a level that abstracts from operational details is increasingly recognized. Two established enterprise modeling approaches are value modeling and business ontology. Business ontology provides abstract descriptions of enterprises in their business context, focusing on what is needed to create and transfer value. Value modeling is a business modeling approach that focuses on the value objects exchanged in business networks. Business ontology and value modeling research is conducted using instruments like REA (Resources, Events, Agents), the Business Model Canvas, the e3value tool set, VDML and the Enterprise Engineering framework.

The goals of the VMBO workshop series are to bring together researchers with an interest in value modeling and business ontology in order to present and discuss the current state of enterprise or business modeling and to identify key areas for further research, including, specifically but not exclusively, innovative business model design, service design, systemic trust for value exchanges, ontologies for modelling economic concepts and institutions, and value-aware systems design.

## Important dates:

- Paper submission: November 24, 2019
- Notification of acceptance: December 8, 2019
- VMBO 2020: January 16-17, 2020

## Instructions for submissions:

If you are interested in joining, please submit a paper in the following categories:

- Full paper (maximum of eight pages): describes original research contributions, presents problems or challenges encountered in practice or reports on industrial cases and practices.
- Short paper (maximum of four pages): describes your main ideas. We encourage you to focus on ideas in progress for which you would like to get feedback from other workshop participants.

If wanted, the accepted papers can be published with CEUR online proceedings. We support the submission of VMBO papers afterwards to a special issue of a journal, e.g. Journal of Applied Ontology (JAO) or Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting (JETA), if possible. Note that submitted papers will be reviewed only marginally. The program committee will use the papers to put together a final program; the aim is to accommodate all relevant papers with sufficient quality.  
  
 Submit your short paper preferably in PDF format and following the (Proceedings) style of Springer LNCS to <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vmbo2020>
