This thesis investigates how blockchain can be used in healthcare applications. The research starts with a study of the state-of-the-art of blockchain applications in healthcare (based on academic literature, popular press, information on the web). This state-of-the-art review of secondary data will be extended with primary data collected through a survey with Belgian hospitals and interviews with experts in medical informatics. Next, existing or planned blockchain applications in other domains will be studied to discover opportunities for application in healthcare. Finally, a potentially promising new application will be designed using enterprise modelling techniques. Using these techniques it can be analysed what the impact of the new blockchain application is on relevant variables like patient satisfaction, patient safety, quality of service, efficiency and costs.
