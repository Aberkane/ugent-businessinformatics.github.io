In September ’16 we applied together with researchers from UHasselt and KULeuven for Research Foundation – Flanders (FWO) funding on supporting a [scientific research community on Process Mining](https://srcprocessmining.com). Recently we received the good news that the FWO accepted our proposal. The grant will mainly leverage international mobility between the flemish and the international partners, to improve collaboration, and to organize symposia on post-doc level.

For your information, the involved partners are:

- Hasselt University
- LIRIS (KULeuven)
- Ugent MIS (Ghent University)
- BusI (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
- Bozen (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano)
- Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya

- Queensland University of Technology
- Rutgers University
- University of Tartu
