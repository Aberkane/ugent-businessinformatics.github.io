CARS is a conceptual modelling approach that we developed with the UGentMIS team to support strategic sourcing in organisations. With CARS, sourcing options can be explored an analysed from the perspective of value co-creation in networks of organisations and other economic actors.

The CARS conceptualisation has not yet been operationalised in a well-defined modelling language. In this thesis, we investigate the use of the standard Enterprise Architecture modelling language, ArchiMate, to represent CARS models and to perform model-based analyses of strategic sourcing options.

This is a theory-oriented project requiring desk research, although an evaluation in a field setting is an option to be considered in the research methodology.

For more information on CARS, see <https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8545318>. As part of the research, collaboration with the original developer of CARS, dr. Laleh Rafati â€“ enterprise architect with ENVISION, is planned.
