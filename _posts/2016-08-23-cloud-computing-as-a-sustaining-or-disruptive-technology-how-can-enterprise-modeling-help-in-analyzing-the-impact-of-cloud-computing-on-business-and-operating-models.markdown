This thesis investigates through a number of case-studies whether Cloud Computing presents a sustaining or disruptive technology, and for which (types of) companies. The impact of Cloud Computing as sustaining/disruptive technology will be modelled and analyzed using various Enterprise Modeling techniques and associated tools (e.g., business model canvas, value delivery model/platform, Archi(Mate), …).

The purpose of the thesis research is to gain additional insights into the role of Cloud Computing as disruptive/sustaining technology and its impact on an organization’s business model and/or business processes. The central research question is how Enterprise Modeling can help organizations in dealing with the impact of Cloud Computing on their business.

Research activities include literature search/analysis of published case-studies and experience reports (both academic as well as professional business/IT literature) and conceptual modeling/analysis using various enterprise modeling tools. Learning to work with such tools is a key learning objective for this thesis, apart from getting intimately familiar with the business aspects of Cloud Computing.
