This thesis aims to explore how the blockchain technology may benefit a Flemish start-up in their day-to-day operations. More specifically, the student will have close contact with the founders of the start-up, and will explore different options on how blockchain technology can be applied. Possible use cases to investigate are: (i) to facilitate global transactions between the start-up and its suppliers, (ii) to support the operations that are performed within the company or (iii) to attract financial capital as a means to financially support the start-up.

Note: Open to all Masters. Due to the cooperation with the start-up, the publication of the thesis will be confidential.
