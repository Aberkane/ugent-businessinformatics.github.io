The UGentMIS research team of the Dept. of Business Informatics and Operations Management will open a **PhD position** (junior assistant) for research and (limited) teaching in Business &amp; IT (teaching requires mastering of the Dutch language). The candidate is expected to complete a PhD research within 4 â€“ 6 years.

The UGentMIS research team is headed by Prof. Geert Poels, assisted by Prof. Frederik Gaillly (associate professor) and Prof. Amy Van Looy (assistant professor). We are active in the domains of *Enterprise Modelling/Architecture* and *Business Process Management* (both from managerial and technological perspectives). The current themes in our research are threefold:

*How to ensure that IT delivers business value (with particular emphasis on business (model) innovation through application of emergent technologies)?*

How to employ IT to better manage business processes (with particular emphasis on administrative and clinical processes in the healthcare sector)?

How mature are organisations in managing digital innovation in business processes (with particular emphasis on citizen-facing processes in the government sector)?

The UGentMIS professors will help the PhD student to define a PhD research topic related to one of these themes.

Our research approach is pragmatic, encompassing both design-based research and mixed methods research. Reference disciplines include Business/Management/Organisational studies, Computer Science, and Information Systems. The PhD student will be trained (as part of the UGent doctoral training programme) in research methodology and domain-specific topics, and the UGentMIS professors will help the candidate to develop an appropriate research plan.

*UGentMIS research is often performed in close collaboration with organisations, like for instance Inno.com, VDMbee, PwC, ISACA, UZGent, Maria Middelares, Collibra, City of Ghent.*

Given the multidisciplinary focus and applied nature of our research bridging business and IT, UGentMIS is actively searching for 2nd Master **Business Engineering students** (all fields of study) or Master students of **Complementary Studies in Business Economics**, with a background in engineering or computer science. Expressions of interest by other students (e.g., **Computer Science**, **Informatics**, **Applied Informatics**, **Business Informatics**, **Engineering**) of Ghent University or other universities (Flanders and abroad) are welcome.

*The PhD position will be opened once one or more suitable candidates have expressed their interest.*

Kind regards  
Prof. dr. Geert Poels
