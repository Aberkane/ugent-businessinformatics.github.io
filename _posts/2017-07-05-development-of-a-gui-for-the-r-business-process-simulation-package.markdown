### Problem Description

Currently there are a lot of simulation tools available. If we look at the landscape of simulation tools, we find business process management tools and business process modeling tools with simulation possibilities as well as tools specifically created for simulation purposes. All of these tools have their own limitations and advantages. In this project, the R Business Process Simulation package (BPS- package) is further developed and demonstrated. This package can be used by process analysts to simulate business process that are represented in BPMN without losing the strong analytic capabilities of R.

### Research Goals

- Further extend the R BPS package
- Create a GUI for the packages
- Demonstrate the use of the package
- Write a tutorial for using the package
